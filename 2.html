	<h2>LOL - Champion</h2>
	<p>
		It is a character manipulated by each player in League of Legends. A total of 159 champions exist, including the Renata Glask based on the Korean server.
		Originally, there was a setting related to the name of the champion. As can be seen from the borrowing of the title of the duel trial, it was possible to explain how they continued to resurrect, why they fought between strangers, friends, and family, and why they lost to a much weaker opponent than the setting, and the summoner controlled the champion's power and slowly adjusted the link. However, as the story became difficult due to the consecutive addition of the champion, the settings related to the summoner were greatly reduced and only the name of the champion remained.
