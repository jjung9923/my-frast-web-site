	<h2>LOL - Patch Note</h2>
	<p>
		A patch note is a note that explains the changes to a new champion or item champion that are periodically updated in League of Legends. Therefore, when you play League of Legends, you must read it if it is important. This is because you can increase the winning rate just by reading this note.
